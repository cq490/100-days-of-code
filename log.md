# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created basic framework, made 'Pomodoro' class as first option of the Timer App. Used Thread.sleep() into a for loop to measure secodns passed.

**Thoughts:** Don't think that Thread.sleep() is the best option to measure time.
